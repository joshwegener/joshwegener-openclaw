- Josh prefers **voice updates** to reduce reading load; keep any copy/paste commands, links, and decision details in text right below the voice note.
- Josh wants **automatic transcription** of inbound voice messages.
  - Installed local STT: `faster-whisper` (pip user install) and successfully transcribed Telegram .ogg voice notes.
- RecallDeck decisions:
  - Decks: **Option A** (de-scope decks for MVP; land clean later).
  - Idempotency: `canonical_key` **returns existing** on duplicate (idempotency-key semantics).
  - Deckhand: put on hold for now (do not work on it).
  - Task board: local Kanban (Kanboard) via Docker Compose at `/Users/joshwegener/Projects/RecallDeck/RecallDeck-Board` (http://localhost:8401). Seeded project “RecallDeck” with swimlanes MVP/Later/Ops, columns Backlog/Doing/Blocked/Review/Done, and initial tasks (MVP + Later epics). Updated RecallDeck-Docs Current/To-Do.md and Current/Agent-Workboard.md to point to Kanboard as source of truth.
