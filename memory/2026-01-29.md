- Josh prefers **voice updates** to reduce reading load; keep any copy/paste commands, links, and decision details in text right below the voice note.
- Josh wants **automatic transcription** of inbound voice messages.
  - Installed local STT: `faster-whisper` (pip user install) and successfully transcribed Telegram .ogg voice notes.
- RecallDeck decisions:
  - Decks: **Option A** (de-scope decks for MVP; land clean later).
  - Idempotency: `canonical_key` **returns existing** on duplicate (idempotency-key semantics).
  - Deckhand: put on hold for now (do not work on it).
