# Chantel — response / texting profile

## Observed texting patterns (last 12 months sample)
- Josh tends to write longer “explain and resolve” texts; Chantel tends to write shorter bursts and uses more exclamation.
- During conflict, Josh’s longer explanatory texts can land as a lecture even when intended as repair (escalation trap).

## What seems to work (Josh → Chantel)
- Short repair / de-escalation lines.
- Affection + reassurance.
- Simple logistics/asks kept clean and brief.

## What to avoid
- Long “here’s why you’re wrong / these were your decisions” paragraphs over text.
- If the topic is loaded, aim for: acknowledge + short repair + suggest talking in person.

## When doing deeper comparisons
- Ask Josh for a “good era” date range (YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD) to compare tone/patterns.
