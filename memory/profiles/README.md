# Response Profiles (load on demand)

This folder holds **per-person response profiles** (tone, constraints, defaults).

- Keep these files short and explicit.
- Do **not** load all of them at startup; instead, load only the profile needed for the current task.

Suggested files:
- `chantel.md`
- `ann.md`
- `dalton.md`
