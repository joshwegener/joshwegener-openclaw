- Model workflow preference: use **Claude** for Gateway / operational work; use **Codex** for thinking/high-level planning; if Codex hits rate limits/errors, temporarily fall back to Claude and then return to Codex when available.
- Codex error observed: stream disconnected before completion due to TPM org rate limit.
- Preference: when sending email lists in chat, add two blank lines between each email entry for scanability.
