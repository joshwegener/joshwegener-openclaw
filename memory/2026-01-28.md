- Model workflow preference: use **Claude** for Gateway / operational work; use **Codex** for planning/implementation. Default Codex CLI profiles: **ghigh** for planning/analysis, **chigh** for coding/implementation. If Codex hits rate limits/errors, temporarily fall back to Claude and then return to Codex when available.
- RecallDeck workflow preference:
  - Planning: run GPT in high mode.
  - Code: use Codex for implementation.
  - Edge cases: use Claude for review.
  - OK to use two git worktrees (GPT in one, Claude in the other).
  - Be autonomous: do not wait for approvals unless an action is external or destructive.
  - Provide at least hourly updates and also update on major changes.
  - Wording: when Josh says "Claude CLI" he often means Codex CLI; default to Codex unless clarified.
- Codex error observed: stream disconnected before completion due to TPM org rate limit.
- Preference: when sending email lists in chat, add two blank lines between each email entry for scanability.
